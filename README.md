# seattle-todo-list
A todo list of the latest and greatest spots in Seattle...even when it's raining!

### Restaurants
* [Royal Grinders](https://www.yelp.com/biz/royal-grinders-seattle-2) (Get the Italian or the Chicken pesto, $11/sandwich)
* [Ramen Danbo](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-danbo-seattle-2) (Chasu Ramen is very good. **WAY** better than Kiki Ramen, $12/bowl)
* [Pie Bar](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pie-bar-seattle-2) (Sweet and Savory pies. Chicken pot pie has pretty flaky crust and hearty fillings but is hard to justify the $17 price point)
* [Qin Xi'an Noodles](https://www.yelp.com/biz/qin-xian-noodles-seattle-3) (Chewy handpulled noodles with lamb or beef. Pretty popular among the Asian crowd. $9-$12)
* [Witness](https://www.yelp.com/biz/witness-seattle) (Southern comfort food. Chicken and waffles are excellent with well-seasoned, juicy dark meat chicken. BLT had sweet, vibrant heirloom tomatoes and bread toasted to perfection. It is a bit pricey as prices range from $13-$18 for brunch.)
### Outdoors (engineers go outside too!)
#### Hiking
* [Mount Si](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-si) (Intermediate; 3000 feet in 4 miles; View is just trees until you get to the top, which is very rocky. Would **NOT** recommend for hiking noobs or first-timers.)
   * Discover pass needed
   * Used as training for Rainer.
