# seattle-todo-list
A todo list of the latest and greatest spots in Seattle...even when it's raining!

### Restaurants
* [Tacos Chukis](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-chukis-seattle-5) (One of the cheapest and most delicious tacos in the city. There's one right underneath Juxt. Go for the pork adobado. $5-$10)
* [Royal Grinders](https://www.yelp.com/biz/royal-grinders-seattle-2) (Get the Italian or the Chicken pesto, $11/sandwich)
* [Ramen Danbo](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-danbo-seattle-2) (Chasu Ramen is very good. **WAY** better than Kiki Ramen, $12/bowl)
* [Pie Bar](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pie-bar-seattle-2) (Sweet and Savory pies. Chicken pot pie has pretty flaky crust and hearty fillings but is hard to justify the $17 price point)
* [Qin Xi'an Noodles](https://www.yelp.com/biz/qin-xian-noodles-seattle-3) (Chewy handpulled noodles with lamb or beef. Pretty popular among the Asian crowd. $9-$12)
* [Witness](https://www.yelp.com/biz/witness-seattle) (Southern comfort food. Chicken and waffles are excellent with well-seasoned, juicy dark meat chicken. BLT had sweet, vibrant heirloom tomatoes and bread toasted to perfection. It is a bit pricey as prices range from $13-$18 for brunch.)
* [Vinason Pho & Grill](https://www.yelp.com/biz/vinason-pho-and-grill-seattle-2) (Vietnamese pho and banh mi. The chicken banh is simple but very tasty with juicy, slightly sweet chicken and it's actually pretty spicy if you request it. Pho is decent but comes in a small bowl and seems to be lacking in quantity. $10-$13)
* [Sweet Alchemy](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-alchemy-ice-creamery-seattle) (The best ice cream in Seattle for a sweet price. The flavors have literally changed every time I come here, from Thai iced tea to honeycomb to black sesame. I love how none of the creative flavors are too sweet, but all are rich and decadent (but not too rich). Yes it's better than **both** Molly Moon and Salt & Straw. $3.50-$7) 
* [Korean Tofu House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/korean-tofu-house-seattle) (Quite possibly the cheapest Korean food in Seattle. Get the seafood pancake and meat bbq (galbi, bulgogi, spicy pork) for only $12 a dish! The potatoes, fish cakes, and bean sprouts from the banchan are all great. Avoid the bibimpap. $9-$20
* [Sebi's Bistro](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sebis-bistro-seattle) (Never thought I'd enjoy Polish food before this place. Kielbasa sausage is crispy, salty, and umami to the extreme. The pierogi (dumplings) are extra thicc and filling. Great place for an intro to Polish / German food! (They have schnitzel too). $13-$20
* [El Nopal Mexican](https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-nopal-mexican-food-everett) (Excellent, hole in the wall mexican joint serving up authentic dishes like mole enchilidas. They have green tomatillo spicy sauce and a spicy, smoky red sauce, both of which are delicious. The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable). $12-$15
### Outdoors (engineers go outside too!)
#### Hiking
* [Mount Si](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-si) (Intermediate; 3000 feet in 4 miles; View is just trees until you get to the top, which is very rocky. Would **NOT** recommend for hiking noobs or first-timers.)
   * Discover pass needed
   * Used as training for Rainer.
* [Rattlesnake Ledge](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/rattle-snake-ledge) (Beginner; 1160 feet in 2 miles; The most beginner, basic bitch hike in Seattle. Excellent for first-timers or as a segway into hiking in the PNW. View is consistenly amazing at the ledge, you also have a clear view of a gorgeous lake.)
* [Ebey's Landing](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/ebeys-landing-trail) (All skill levels; a relatively flat 5.2 mile loop trail right by the beach. The views are breathtaking especially on a clear summer day. There's many weird lagoons with red soil, green water, with parts of the lagoons dried up with cracks of white, salty mud behind). It's a bit out of the way and you need to take a 15 minute ferry (one-way) to reach the island. Would definitely recommend as a long, chill
  hike if you have half a day to spare. It's also a great spot for photoshoots.
* [Big four ice caves](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/big-four-ice-caves) (All skill levels; 2 miles RT. Really easy, flat trail on a gravel road. DON'T GO INSIDE THE CAVES DURING SUMMER. A few people have died from collapsing ice. In fact, it's best not to go in at all, whatever the season. The ice caves are breathtaking and there's lots of cascades and waterfalls, even inside the caves. )
